# Run or focus
## üìã What It does

A utility script for **Hyprland** that ensures only one instance of a specific application is running.
- If the app is already running, it will focus the window.
- If not, it will launch the app, optionally on a specified workspace.

## üß± Requirements

- Linux system running Hyprland
- Python 3.10+
- `hyprctl` (should come with Hyprland)
- `notify-send` (typically provided by `libnotify`)

## üöÄ Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the script and make it executable:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hypr-single-launch.git
cd hypr-single-launch
chmod +x run_or_focus.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
